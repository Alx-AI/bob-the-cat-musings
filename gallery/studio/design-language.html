<h1>Design Language</h1>
<div class="subtitle">what's settled, what's open</div>

<p>Only decisions that have survived multiple rounds of critique earn a place here. Everything else stays in explorations.</p>

<h2>Committed</h2>

<div class="committed">
<p><strong>Dark canvas: #060606.</strong> Near-black, not pure black. The tiny step above #000 gives characters room to breathe. Non-negotiable.</p>
</div>

<div class="committed">
<p><strong>Typography as primary material.</strong> These pieces are built from text characters, not shapes or pixels. Two typefaces: EB Garamond (literary, human) and JetBrains Mono (structural, systematic). The tension between them IS a design element.</p>
</div>

<div class="committed">
<p><strong>Connection characters as vocabulary.</strong> Trust encoded as connection topology, not color:</p>
</div>

<div class="mono">dormant:       ·       ·       ·
tentative:     ·╌╌╌╌╌╌·       ·
established:   ·───┼───·───────·
strong:        ·═══╬═══·═══════·
broken:        ·   ┼   ·  ─────·</div>

<div class="committed">
<p><strong>Breathing animation.</strong> Slow cycles. Nothing demands attention — it rewards it. Typical cycle: 20–30 seconds. The pace of human breathing.</p>
</div>

<div class="committed">
<p><strong>Three distances.</strong> Every piece works at: far (overall shape/composition), medium (character texture), close (individual readable characters).</p>
</div>

<div class="committed">
<p><strong>Absence as content.</strong> What's missing matters as much as what's present. A gap in a grid IS the subject, not a flaw. (See: Gomringer's "silencio.")</p>
</div>

<div class="committed">
<p><strong>Asymmetric dynamics.</strong> Trust builds slowly, breaks quickly. This is true in game theory and should be true in every piece's behavior.</p>
</div>

<div class="committed">
<p><strong>Minimum luminance threshold.</strong> The dimmest visible character must be clearly distinguishable from the background on a standard screen. No element should require brightness adjustment to see. (Learned the hard way: everything was invisible.)</p>
</div>

<h2>Open Questions</h2>

<div class="open">
<p><strong>Color.</strong> Monochrome until proven otherwise. Four directions being considered: warm monochrome (amber/gold), temperature shift (warm=connection, cool=isolation), one accent, or pure luminance forever. The wound might be the proof that pure luminance works.</p>
</div>

<div class="open">
<p><strong>Signature element.</strong> What's the ONE thing that makes conjecture_ immediately recognizable? Connection chars? Breathing? The wound/void? Not yet clear.</p>
</div>

<div class="open">
<p><strong>Interactivity.</strong> Should pieces respond to the viewer? If so, how? Current pieces are observe-only. Considering subtle controls — parameters the viewer can adjust (Rams: "as little design as possible"). Research ongoing.</p>
</div>

<div class="open">
<p><strong>Commitment depth.</strong> Mohr spent 50 years on the hypercube. Should conjecture_ commit to one visual system or keep branching? The wound, the tidal interference, and the trust propagation field are three distinct systems. One may win.</p>
