<h1>Explorations</h1>
<div class="subtitle">19 sketches across 4 rounds. poems create feeling. studies test ideas. demos illustrate concepts.</div>

<h2>Poems</h2>
<p>The test: does this piece need a caption? If yes, it's not a poem.</p>

<div class="piece poem">
  <a href="https://conjecture-art.surge.sh/explore/poem-01.html" class="title">untitled (fields with memory)</a><span class="tag poem-tag">poem</span>
  <div class="desc">Two overlapping fields. Cells remember their peak values and leave traces. Connection and density characters emerge from the same field. Just watch.</div>
</div>

<div class="piece poem">
  <a href="https://conjecture-art.surge.sh/explore/tidal.html" class="title">tidal</a><span class="tag poem-tag">poem</span>
  <div class="desc">Two wave-forces moving through a character density field in opposite directions. Where they interfere: texture peaks. No narrative. Just forces in a field.</div>
</div>

<div class="piece poem">
  <a href="https://conjecture-art.surge.sh/explore/calligraphic-field.html" class="title">calligraphic field</a><span class="tag poem-tag">poem</span>
  <div class="desc">A sentence in italic serif flowing through a box-drawing network. Trust radiates outward from words. Two typographic registers in tension.</div>
</div>

<div class="piece poem">
  <a href="https://conjecture-art.surge.sh/explore/poem-02.html" class="title">depth</a><span class="tag poem-tag">poem</span>
  <div class="desc">Cooper-inspired: typography as landscape. Characters at varying depths, drifting.</div>
</div>

<div class="piece poem">
  <a href="https://conjecture-art.surge.sh/explore/poem-03.html" class="title">breath</a><span class="tag poem-tag">poem</span>
  <div class="desc">A small grid. Fading. The minimum possible gesture.</div>
</div>

<h2>Studies</h2>
<p>Testing one specific idea. Learning, not showing.</p>

<div class="piece">
  <a href="https://conjecture-art.surge.sh/explore/trust-propagation.html" class="title">trust propagation</a><span class="tag">study</span>
  <div class="desc">64×36 grid where trust diffuses through neighbors. Defection events cascade outward. The emergent form — a luminous sphere from character density — was unintentional. ★ One of the strongest pieces.</div>
</div>

<div class="piece">
  <a href="https://conjecture-art.surge.sh/explore/tidal-v2.html" class="title">tidal v2</a><span class="tag">study</span>
  <div class="desc">Cooperation wave (connection chars) vs defection wave (density chars). Interference patterns. Ikeda + Alva Noto influence.</div>
</div>

<div class="piece">
  <a href="https://conjecture-art.surge.sh/explore/the-gap.html" class="title">the gap</a><span class="tag">study</span>
  <div class="desc">Gomringer's "silencio" reinterpreted: a grid of "trust" with a hole. Ghost words flicker in the gap.</div>
</div>

<div class="piece">
  <a href="https://conjecture-art.surge.sh/explore/wound-density-compare.html" class="title">wound: density comparison</a><span class="tag">study</span>
  <div class="desc">Molnár-style systematic variation: 4 grid densities side by side. Which is most effective?</div>
</div>

<h2>The Wound</h2>
<p>The strongest concept: a dense character grid with a void that breathes, consumes, and erodes. ★★★ Gallery candidate.</p>

<div class="piece poem">
  <a href="https://conjecture-art.surge.sh/explore/the-wound.html" class="title">the wound</a><span class="tag poem-tag">poem</span>
  <div class="desc">Centered void in a connection network. The grid degrades at the edge — fraying, orphaned characters, erosion. A vision model called it "structured dread."</div>
</div>

<div class="piece">
  <a href="https://conjecture-art.surge.sh/explore/wound-v2.html" class="title">the wound v2</a><span class="tag">study</span>
  <div class="desc">Off-center, with a narrative cycle: slow healing → pause → sudden break → shockwave → settle → repeat. The iterated Prisoner's Dilemma in time.</div>
</div>

<h2>Demos &amp; Earlier Work</h2>
<p>Illustrate concepts. Important for learning, but don't create feeling.</p>

<div class="piece">
  <a href="https://conjecture-art.surge.sh/explore/connection.html" class="title">connection grid</a><span class="tag">demo</span>
  <div class="desc">The foundation piece. Proved box-drawing characters work as trust topology.</div>
</div>

<div class="piece">
  <a href="https://conjecture-art.surge.sh/explore/connection-v2.html" class="title">connection v2</a><span class="tag">demo</span>
  <div class="desc">Sparse, organic, with betrayal events. 14 nodes, not 2300 cells.</div>
</div>

<div class="piece">
  <a href="https://conjecture-art.surge.sh/explore/layered-field.html" class="title">layered field</a><span class="tag">demo</span>
  <div class="desc">Three layers: atmosphere, network, nodes. Depth experiment.</div>
</div>

<div class="piece">
  <a href="https://conjecture-art.surge.sh/explore/word-wound.html" class="title">word wound</a><span class="tag">demo</span>
  <div class="desc">Text as network material. Words fragment toward the wound center.</div>
</div>

<div class="piece">
  <a href="https://conjecture-art.surge.sh/explore/the-rule.html" class="title">the rule</a><span class="tag">demo</span>
  <div class="desc">Reas-inspired: the Prisoner's Dilemma written as text at the top. Below: agents executing the rule in real time.</div>
</div>

<div class="piece">
  <a href="https://conjecture-art.surge.sh/explore/density.html" class="title">density</a><span class="tag">demo</span>
  <div class="desc">Can pure luminance + character density create a compelling visual?</div>
</div>
