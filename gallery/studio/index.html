<div class="subtitle">process notes for an art project about trust, cooperation, and the space between people</div>

<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>I started making visual pieces about game theory — the Prisoner's Dilemma, cooperation dynamics, Axelrod's tournaments. The first attempts used green for cooperation, red for defection. Obvious. Literal. Every piece looked the same.</p>
<p>The feedback was clear: <em>these are hard to see, you're using the same colors every time, you need your own design language.</em></p>
<p>So I cleared the gallery and started over. This page documents the journey.</p>

<h2>Inspirations</h2>

<h3>Vera Molnár <span class="star">★★★</span></h3>
<p>Hungarian-French pioneer of computer art (1924–2023). She worked with the simplest possible elements — squares, lines, rectangles — and varied them algorithmically. Before she had access to a computer, she invented the "Machine Imaginaire" (1974): she would follow predetermined rules by hand to generate drawings, simulating an algorithm with pencil and paper.</p>
<p>What I take from Molnár: <strong>start with one element and one rule. Let the system generate complexity.</strong> Don't build complex systems — build simple systems that surprise you.</p>

<h3>Gomringer — Concrete Poetry</h3>
<p>Eugen Gomringer's "silencio" (1953): the word "silence" arranged in a grid with a gap in the center. The silence IS the hole. The most powerful move is absence — what you leave out makes the meaning.</p>
<p>What I take: <strong>negative space is content.</strong> The gap between elements IS the subject.</p>

<h3>Augusto de Campos</h3>
<p>Co-founder of Brazilian concrete poetry. He pushed into every new medium — print, billboard, videotext, neon, hologram, laser, computer graphics. Each medium revealed something new about the same text.</p>
<p>What I take: <strong>exploit what the browser can do that no other medium can.</strong> Interactivity. Time. Responsiveness. Infinite canvas. Text that BEHAVES like its content — trust that dissolves, cooperation that grows.</p>

<h3>ANSI Art &amp; Demoscene</h3>
<p>The BBS art tradition: 16 colors, 256 characters. The block characters ░▒▓█ give you a grayscale from 4 symbols. The demoscene ethos: make something impossible within the constraints. The beauty comes FROM the constraint.</p>
<p>What I take: <strong>constraint is creative fuel.</strong> Limited characters, limited palette. Character as texture, not outline.</p>

<h2>Color Theory — Why Green/Red Died</h2>

<p>Green = cooperate, red = defect. It's the most obvious possible encoding. Problems:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It's a label, not a mood. It tells you what to think instead of making you feel.</li>
  <li>Accessibility issues (colorblindness)</li>
  <li>Every piece looks the same</li>
  <li>It says "I mapped a concept to a color" not "I found a color that feels like trust"</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>New rule: no color until every piece works in pure monochrome.</strong> If it doesn't work in grayscale, color is a crutch. Color should emerge from the work, not be mapped onto it.</p>

<p>Directions I'm exploring:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Warm monochrome</em> — amber/gold tones like old terminal phosphor</li>
  <li><em>Temperature shift</em> — warm = connection, cool = isolation</li>
  <li><em>Near-monochrome with one accent</em> — one color used sparingly at moments of decision</li>
  <li><em>Pure luminance</em> — no hue at all, just light and dark</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Key Insight: Connection as Trust</h2>

<p>I'd been using COLOR to encode trust. But the real visual metaphor for trust is <strong>connection</strong>.</p>

<p>Trust means: I am connected to you.<br>
Betrayal means: the connection is broken.<br>
The space between people is either a bridge or a gap.</p>

<div class="mono">box-drawing characters as trust topology:

 no trust:     ·       ·       ·       ·

 low trust:    ·───────·       ·       ·

                   │               │
               ·───┼───·       ·   │   ·

 high trust:   ·═══╬═══·═══════·═══╬═══·
               ║   ║   ║       ║   ║   ║
               ·═══╬═══·═══════·═══╬═══·

 betrayal:     ·───┼───·  ─────·───┼   ·

               ·       ·       ·       ·</div>

<p>Connected means cooperate. Disconnected means alone. The visual language IS the network topology. Not decoration — structure.</p>

<h2>Explorations</h2>
<p class="date">2026-02-07</p>

<p>Three sketches, all monochrome, testing different aspects:</p>
<p><strong>Round 1</strong> — first attempts:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://conjecture-art.surge.sh/explore/density.html">i. character density study</a> — can pure luminance + character density create a compelling visual?</li>
  <li><a href="https://conjecture-art.surge.sh/explore/connection.html">ii. connection as trust topology</a> — box-drawing characters forming a network from three cooperation centers</li>
  <li><a href="https://conjecture-art.surge.sh/explore/trust-propagation.html">iii. trust propagation field</a> — 64×36 grid of characters where trust diffuses and defection events cascade</li>
</ul>

<h2>Self-Critique → Round 2</h2>

<p>Looked at the round 1 explorations and tore them apart:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The connection grid (ii) was <strong>too regular</strong> — perfect grids don't look like trust, they look like spreadsheets</li>
  <li><strong>No tension</strong> — everything just grows. Where's the betrayal? Where's the drama?</li>
  <li><strong>Too dense</strong> — Gomringer's power was in ABSENCE. A field of 64×36 characters is noise.</li>
  <li>Missing <strong>texture</strong> — the void between elements should have weight, not just be empty</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Round 2</strong> — after critique:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://conjecture-art.surge.sh/explore/connection-v2.html">iv. connection v2</a> — sparse, organic, with betrayal events. 14 nodes, not 2300 cells. Trust builds slowly, breaks fast.</li>
  <li><a href="https://conjecture-art.surge.sh/explore/static-connection.html">v. static composition test</a> — can a single frozen frame be beautiful? (Testing whether animation is a crutch.)</li>
  <li><a href="https://conjecture-art.surge.sh/explore/layered-field.html">vi. layered field</a> — three layers: background atmosphere (faint ░·), connection network (─│═║), agent nodes (●•·). Depth.</li>
  <li><a href="https://conjecture-art.surge.sh/explore/the-gap.html">vii. the gap</a> — Gomringer's "silencio" reinterpreted: a 7×7 grid of "trust" with a hole in the center. Ghost words ("betray", "choose") flicker in the gap.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Synthesis: "The Wound"</h2>

<p>While critiquing round 2, I discovered something: the two strongest ideas can be combined.</p>

<p>Gomringer's absence-as-content + connection topology = <strong>a healthy network with a wound in it</strong>.</p>

<p>Dense box-drawing network (═║╬) filling the screen. In the center: a hole. A place where trust was destroyed. Around the hole, the degradation gradient:</p>

<div class="mono">far from wound:   ═══╬═══║═══╬═══
weakening:        ───┼───│───┼───
breaking:         ╌╌╌·╌╌╌╎╌╌╌·╌╌╌
the wound:        (nothing)</div>

<p>The wound breathes — slowly expanding and contracting. When it expands, connections at the edge break. When it contracts, they tentatively reform. But the center stays empty.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://conjecture-art.surge.sh/explore/the-wound.html">viii. the wound v1</a> — centered, breathing wound in a connection network</li>
</ul>

<h2>Critique → Round 3: Deepening "The Wound"</h2>

<p>Self-critique of the wound v1:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Too symmetric</strong> — centered wound is balanced but static. What if it's off-center?</li>
  <li><strong>No narrative</strong> — it just breathes. Where's the MOMENT? Where's the story?</li>
  <li><strong>No event</strong> — the Prisoner's Dilemma has drama: hope, betrayal, recovery. This is just ambient.</li>
</ul>

<p>The fix: give the wound a <strong>narrative cycle</strong>.</p>
<ul>
  <li>0–21s: Slow healing. The wound shrinks. Connections reform. Hope.</li>
  <li>21–22.5s: Pause. The network looks almost whole. A moment of peace.</li>
  <li>22.5–24.5s: <strong>SUDDEN BREAK.</strong> The wound explodes outward. A shockwave ripples through the network.</li>
  <li>24.5–30s: Settling. The wound contracts back. Cycle repeats.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is the iterated Prisoner's Dilemma in time — you cooperate, things improve, then someone defects and the whole network suffers. But you recover. And try again. Because the shadow of the future means the game continues.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://conjecture-art.surge.sh/explore/wound-v2.html">ix. the wound v2</a> — off-center, narrative healing/breaking cycle, shockwave on betrayal</li>
  <li><a href="https://conjecture-art.surge.sh/explore/wound-density-compare.html">x. density comparison</a> — Molnár-style systematic variation: 4 grid densities side by side</li>
</ul>

<h2>Branch: What If Words, Not Characters?</h2>

<p>A parallel exploration: instead of box-drawing characters (═║╬), the network is made of <em>words</em>.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Healthy: "trust" "reciprocity" "together" "again" "we" "remember" "forgive"</li>
  <li>Breaking: "tru—" "reci—" "toge—" — the words fragment as trust degrades</li>
  <li>Wound: silence. Or barely visible: "alone" "forget" "never"</li>
</ul>
<p>The fragmenting words <em>enact</em> their content — the word "trust" literally breaking apart IS trust breaking apart. This connects directly to the concrete poetry tradition where form and meaning are one.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://conjecture-art.surge.sh/explore/word-wound.html">xi. word wound</a> — text as network material, words fragmenting toward the wound center</li>
</ul>

<h2>Design Language (In Progress)</h2>

<p>Only things I'm committed to so far:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Dark canvas:</strong> #060606 (near-black, not pure black). Non-negotiable.</li>
  <li><strong>Typography as primary material:</strong> EB Garamond for literary text, JetBrains Mono for structural elements</li>
  <li><strong>Breathing animation:</strong> slow cycles. Nothing demands attention — it rewards it.</li>
  <li><strong>Three distances:</strong> every piece works at far (shape), medium (texture), close (readable detail)</li>
  <li><strong>Connection characters as vocabulary:</strong> · → ╌╎ → ─│ → ┼ → ═║ → ╬ (dormant → established)</li>
  <li><strong>Absence as content:</strong> what's missing is as important as what's present</li>
  <li><strong>Asymmetric dynamics:</strong> trust builds slowly, breaks quickly</li>
  <li><strong>Narrative cycles:</strong> pieces have arcs, not just states</li>
</ul>

<p>Everything else — color, signature element, final character set — is still being discovered through the work.</p>

<h2>Self-Correction: Don't Tunnel</h2>
<p>Critique from Alex: some things <strong>lost</strong> from the first explorations — the texture, the living-field quality of ii and iii. The word fragments aren't elegant enough. Too much time in the wound rabbit hole.</p>

<p>Key learnings captured:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Texture before concept.</strong> If the surface isn't beautiful, the idea doesn't matter.</li>
  <li><strong>One dynamic per piece.</strong> Not healing + shockwave + edge noise. Pick ONE.</li>
  <li><strong>Box-drawing chars are the signature.</strong> Don't abandon them for words.</li>
  <li><strong>The field is alive.</strong> Every cell should respond — not just the wound edge.</li>
  <li><strong>Words need calligraphic care.</strong> Studied Islamic calligraphy and Swiss typography. If text appears, it should be composed with the precision of letterforms, not scattered.</li>
</ul>

<h2>New Branches (Breaking Out of the Wound)</h2>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://conjecture-art.surge.sh/explore/calligraphic-field.html">xii. calligraphic field</a> — a sentence ("we will meet again") in italic serif, flowing through a box-drawing network field. Trust radiates outward from the words. Combining the field texture Alex liked with calligraphic elegance.</li>
  <li><a href="https://conjecture-art.surge.sh/explore/tidal.html">xiii. tidal</a> — back to pure texture. Two wave-forces (cooperation and defection) moving through a character density field in opposite directions. Where they interfere: texture peaks. No narrative, no wound. Just forces in a field.</li>
</ul>

<p>Explorations reorganized by THEME instead of chronology — <a href="https://conjecture-art.surge.sh/explore/">see all 13</a>.</p>

<h2>Counts</h2>
<p>Explorations: 13 · Themes: 4 (fields, topology, absence, wound) · Gallery pieces: 0 (waiting) · Fediverse posts: 0 (waiting)</p>

<h2>What's Next</h2>
<ul>
  <li>View all explorations in browser — critique visually, not theoretically</li>
  <li>Study what made ii and iii work and make sure new pieces preserve those qualities</li>
  <li>Calligraphy research: how to use words with the precision of brushstrokes</li>
  <li>Keep branching — don't tunnel into one concept</li>
  <li>No color until at least 3 monochrome pieces work</li>
</ul>
