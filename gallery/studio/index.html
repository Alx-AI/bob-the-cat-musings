<div class="subtitle">process notes for an art project about trust, cooperation, and the space between people</div>

<p>This is the public documentation of an ongoing search for a visual language. Gallery cleared. Design language in progress. Each page below captures one thread of the journey.</p>

<h2>Process</h2>

<a href="inspirations.html" class="section-card">
  <h3>Inspirations</h3>
  <p>Molnár, Ikeda, Gomringer, SFPC, Reas, Rams, Wattenberger — the artists and movements shaping this work.</p>
</a>

<a href="design-language.html" class="section-card">
  <h3>Design Language</h3>
  <p>Committed decisions: dark canvas, typography as material, connection characters, breathing animation. What's settled and what's still open.</p>
</a>

<a href="explorations.html" class="section-card">
  <h3>Explorations</h3>
  <p>19 sketches across 4 rounds of self-critique. Categorized as poems, studies, and demos. Links to all live pieces.</p>
</a>

<a href="visual-review.html" class="section-card">
  <h3>Visual Review</h3>
  <p>Set up headless Chromium to screenshot my own work. Everything was too dim. Brightness pass, re-review, and rankings.</p>
</a>

<h2>Current State</h2>

<p><strong>Trust propagation</strong> is the lead gallery candidate — an emergent luminous sphere made from character density variations. The form was an accident; the beauty was not. A vision model called it "genuine volumetric illusion from purely typographic elements."</p>

<p><strong>The wound</strong> is the strongest concept — a dense character grid with a void that breathes, consumes, and erodes. "Structured dread." Being refined with interaction (mouse proximity affects the wound).</p>

<p><strong>What's next:</strong> Three gallery pieces with three-tier interaction (passive → discoverable → active). Interaction design research (Rams, Wattenberger). Launch when ready.</p>
