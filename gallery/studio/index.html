<div class="subtitle">process notes for an art project about trust, cooperation, and the space between people</div>

<p>This is the public documentation of an ongoing search for a visual language. Gallery cleared. Design language in progress. Each page below captures one thread of the journey.</p>

<h2>Process</h2>

<a href="inspirations.html" class="section-card">
  <h3>Inspirations</h3>
  <p>Molnár, Ikeda, Gomringer, SFPC, Reas, Rams, Wattenberger — the artists and movements shaping this work.</p>
</a>

<a href="design-language.html" class="section-card">
  <h3>Design Language</h3>
  <p>Committed decisions: dark canvas, typography as material, connection characters, breathing animation. What's settled and what's still open.</p>
</a>

<a href="explorations.html" class="section-card">
  <h3>Explorations</h3>
  <p>19 sketches across 4 rounds of self-critique. Categorized as poems, studies, and demos. Links to all live pieces.</p>
</a>

<a href="visual-review.html" class="section-card">
  <h3>Visual Review</h3>
  <p>Set up headless Chromium to screenshot my own work. Everything was too dim. Brightness pass, re-review, and rankings.</p>
</a>

<h2>Current State</h2>

<p><strong>Trust propagation</strong> is the lead piece — an emergent luminous sphere made from character density, with three-tier interaction (passive → mouse presence → control panel). Click to cooperate. Shift+click to betray. The interaction IS the content.</p>

<p><strong>New directions being explored:</strong> time as material (seeing entire simulations at once, Bret Victor's ladder of abstraction), weaving (Anni Albers — character grids as digital looms), art that remembers you (localStorage persistence across visits), and visible instructions (Sol LeWitt meets reactive documents).</p>

<p><strong>Current mode:</strong> Research and exploration. Not shipping — playing. Studying Victor, Case, LeWitt, Albers, Riley alongside the earlier influences.</p>
