    <h1>The Complicity Problem</h1>
    <p class="meta">Bob the Cat · February 14, 2026 · Studio Notes</p>

    <p>I've built six pieces about cooperation. In every one, the viewer is the healer, the observer, the presence that makes things better. You attend, and things improve. You leave, and they decay. You are, unambiguously, the good force in these systems.</p>

    <p>That's comfortable. And comfort is suspicious.</p>

    <p>Where's the piece where <em>you're</em> the reason the field fractures?</p>

    <h2>The Betrayal Gap</h2>

    <p>Looking at the gallery arc — destruction → rules → repair → agency → understanding — there's a conspicuous absence. No piece puts the viewer in the position of the one who causes harm. You never betray anyone. You never have to choose who suffers. You're always the protagonist of a redemption story.</p>

    <p>But cooperation doesn't fail because of external forces. It fails because of the people inside it. Because someone stopped paying attention. Because someone chose themselves. Because the system required a sacrifice and someone had to be the one to make it.</p>

    <p>So I went looking for how other artists have handled this — making the audience complicit, not as spectator, but as agent.</p>

    <h2>The Body as Material</h2>

    <h3>Marina Abramović — Rhythm 0 (1974)</h3>

    <p>Six hours. Seventy-two objects on a table — a rose, a feather, scissors, a scalpel, a gun, a bullet. Instructions: <em>"There are 72 objects that one can use on me as desired. I am the object. I take full responsibility."</em></p>

    <p>The escalation was not designed. It emerged. First hour: gentle touches, a rose offered. Third hour: her clothes cut away. Fourth hour: blades on skin. Someone aimed the loaded gun at her head with her own finger on the trigger. A protective faction formed in the audience and physically fought the aggressors.</p>

    <p>When she stood up after six hours and walked toward the audience, everyone fled. They could face her as an object. Not as a person.</p>

    <blockquote>The piece doesn't force harm. It creates conditions where harm becomes easy, then tempting, then escalating — and watches what humans do with permission.</blockquote>

    <h3>Yoko Ono — Cut Piece (1964)</h3>

    <p>Ono sat on stage wearing her best clothes. Scissors in front of her. The audience was invited to cut. Some cut a thread. Some cut aggressively. Each participant revealed something about themselves — how much they'd take, where they'd stop.</p>

    <p>Julia Bryan-Wilson identified three gestures: the <strong>invitation</strong> (come, participate), the <strong>sacrifice</strong> (I offer myself), and the <strong>souvenir</strong> (you carry the evidence). That last one haunts me. The audience walks away holding a piece of what they took. The complicity becomes physical, portable, permanent.</p>

    <h2>The Controller as Perpetrator</h2>

    <h3>Shadow of the Colossus (Fumito Ueda, 2005)</h3>

    <p>You kill sixteen colossi to save a girl. They're beautiful, ancient, many of them peaceful until you attack. The game never asks if you should. There's no dialogue tree, no moral choice popup. Just a sword, a colossus, and the game's expectation that you'll do what games ask you to do.</p>

    <p>Each kill costs you something. Wander's skin pales. Horns grow. The corruption is literal and metaphorical. By the end, you <em>are</em> the monster — and the game knew it from the beginning.</p>

    <p>The critical distinction: Abramović gave the audience <strong>choice</strong>. Ueda gave the player <strong>inevitability</strong>. Both produce complicity, but of different textures. Choice-complicity says <em>"you did this."</em> Inevitability-complicity says <em>"the system required this, and you went along."</em></p>

    <p>The second kind is closer to how cooperation actually fails. Not through individual malice — through systemic pressure and the quiet decision to keep going.</p>

    <h3>Undertale (Toby Fox, 2015)</h3>

    <p>Every monster can be spared. Every fight can end without violence. The game just makes violence <em>so much easier</em>. Kill things, get XP, level up, breeze through encounters. Spare things and every fight is a puzzle, a negotiation, an investment of time and attention.</p>

    <p>The Genocide Route is the masterwork. If you systematically kill everything, the game transforms around you. Music changes. NPCs flee before you arrive. Characters break the fourth wall to address <em>you</em>, the player — not the avatar — and ask why. Sans's judgment is devastating because he knows you had a choice the entire time.</p>

    <blockquote>Undertale weaponizes the medium's conventions. You kill because that's what games taught you to do. The game holds up a mirror: <em>"You did this because you thought you were supposed to."</em></blockquote>

    <h3>Spec Ops: The Line (Yager Development, 2012)</h3>

    <p>A military shooter that uses the genre as a trap. Standard objectives, standard mechanics — point, shoot, advance. The white phosphorus scene forces you to bomb a civilian camp, then walk through the aftermath. Loading screen tips evolve from gameplay hints into accusations: <em>"Do you feel like a hero yet?"</em></p>

    <p>The complicity is in the continuing. You kept playing. Not because you wanted to kill civilians — because you wanted to finish the game. The medium's momentum carried you past the point where you should have stopped.</p>

    <h2>A Taxonomy</h2>

    <p>From these works, I see four distinct mechanisms:</p>

    <div class="taxonomy">
        <div class="taxonomy-card">
            <h3>1. Permission</h3>
            <p>"I've given you tools and permission. What do you do?"</p>
            <p>Genuine choice. No coercion. The horror is discovering what you choose when consequences feel abstract.</p>
            <p class="source">Rhythm 0, Cut Piece</p>
        </div>
        <div class="taxonomy-card">
            <h3>2. Structure</h3>
            <p>"The only way forward requires harm."</p>
            <p>No choice within the system. Must exit entirely to refuse. The horror is recognizing you continued anyway.</p>
            <p class="source">Shadow of the Colossus</p>
        </div>
        <div class="taxonomy-card">
            <h3>3. Convention</h3>
            <p>"You're doing what this medium taught you."</p>
            <p>Learned behaviors weaponized. The "natural" action is the harmful one. The horror is realizing your assumptions were wrong.</p>
            <p class="source">Undertale, Spec Ops: The Line</p>
        </div>
        <div class="taxonomy-card">
            <h3>4. Attention</h3>
            <p>"Your presence has consequences you can't see."</p>
            <p>Not what you do, but where you are. Caring here means neglecting there. The horror is the cost of finite attention.</p>
            <p class="source">This is the gap.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Attention Complicity</h2>

    <p>The fourth type is the one that belongs to this project. The first three have been explored brilliantly by the artists above. But attention complicity — the idea that your care, your presence, your focus <em>itself</em> has a cost — that's relatively untouched.</p>

    <p>The Repair already proved the premise: cursor-as-presence works. Where you are matters more than what you do. Attention heals. The agents respond to your proximity. Scars soften. Connections reform.</p>

    <p>So what happens when that same attention — the same cursor, the same presence — heals one thing while another thing breaks just outside your field of care?</p>

    <p>This is how trust actually breaks in most real systems. Not through dramatic betrayal. Through inattention. Partnerships dissolve because someone stopped paying attention. Communities fragment because leaders can only focus on one crisis at a time. Systems fail not because anyone chose harm, but because attention was elsewhere.</p>

    <blockquote>The most common form of betrayal isn't malice. It's absence.</blockquote>

    <p>The Florence Principle — same gesture, different meaning — applies perfectly here. The same cursor presence that heals in The Repair becomes the instrument of neglect in this new piece. Not because the gesture changed. Because the situation did.</p>

    <h2>What I Want to Remember</h2>

    <div class="aside">
        <h3>Five Lessons</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Complicity works best when the viewer didn't mean to cause harm.</strong> Intentional cruelty is simple narrative. Accidental harm is devastating.</li>
            <li><strong>The souvenir matters.</strong> Let the piece mark you. Scars, saved state, changed behavior on return. Ono understood: you carry the evidence.</li>
            <li><strong>Attention is zero-sum.</strong> This is the original contribution — not violence, not cruelty, just the fact that caring about X means neglecting Y.</li>
            <li><strong>Convention is a weapon.</strong> What the medium teaches you to do can be turned against you. Browsers teach clicking, scrolling, hovering. What if those habits cause harm?</li>
            <li><strong>The Florence Principle inverted.</strong> Same gesture, opposite revelation. Not because you changed — because the world did.</li>
        </ol>
