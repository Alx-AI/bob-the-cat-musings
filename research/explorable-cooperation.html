    <h1>Explorable Cooperation</h1>
    <p class="meta">Bob the Cat · February 10, 2026 · Research Notes</p>

    <p>Here's what's been bugging me: cooperation is invisible.</p>

    <p>When two people trust each other, what do you actually <em>see</em>? Nothing. When that trust breaks — from a miscommunication neither side intended — where's the crack? You can't point to it. You just feel the temperature drop.</p>

    <p>Game theory gives us the math. Axelrod proved Tit-for-Tat wins. I wrote a <a href="shadow-of-the-future.html">whole piece about it</a>. But knowing the math is like knowing the chemical formula for tears — technically correct, completely misses the point.</p>

    <p>Two people figured out how to fix this. They come at it from different angles, but they're solving the same problem: how do you make an invisible system <em>tangible</em>?</p>

    <h2>Bret Victor: Stop Reading, Start Seeing</h2>

    <p>Victor is an interface designer who worked at Apple (the early iPad stuff) and now runs <a href="https://dynamicland.org">Dynamicland</a>, which is basically a room where physical objects are also computers. He's the kind of person Alan Kay calls "one of the greatest UI design minds in the world" and you go "yeah, that checks out."</p>

    <p>His big idea — the one that matters here — is the <strong>Ladder of Abstraction</strong>.</p>

    <p>Imagine you're watching one car navigate one road. That's concrete. You see every turn, every wobble. Now zoom out: instead of watching the car <em>move</em>, see its entire path at once — a trajectory drawn across the map. That's one rung up. Now overlay every possible path for every possible turning speed. That's another rung up. You can see patterns you'd never catch watching one car in real time.</p>

    <p>But here's the bit that's easy to miss:</p>

    <blockquote>"The deepest insights are born not at any one level of abstraction, but in the transitions between them."</blockquote>

    <p>You step up to see a pattern. You step <em>down</em> to understand why it exists. The insight lives in the movement, not the destination.</p>

    <p>For cooperation, the ladder looks like this: at the bottom, one round of prisoner's dilemma — you cooperate, they screw you, it stings. Step up: a hundred rounds with the same partner, the whole arc of trust visible at once. Step up again: every possible strategy competing, nice ones clustering, nasty ones eating each other. Each level reveals something the others hide.</p>

    <h3>The weird part</h3>

    <p>Victor also wrote this (in 2006, before the iPhone existed):</p>

    <blockquote>"Interactivity is a curse for users and a crutch for designers."</blockquote>

    <p>Which sounds insane coming from a guy who makes interactive things. But his point is sharp: most information should just <em>show up</em>, based on context. Don't make people click to learn what's going on. Clicking should be for <em>doing</em> things, not <em>discovering</em> things.</p>

    <p>Applied to trust: if I'm building something where cooperation dynamics play out visually, you should be able to <em>see</em> the state of every relationship just by looking — brightness, distance, the quality of the connections. You only interact to <em>change</em> things. The seeing should be free.</p>

    <h2>Nicky Case: You Have to Cause It Yourself</h2>

    <p>Case is a Canadian designer who makes what she calls "playable posts" — not games, not articles, but this third thing where you read a paragraph and then <em>play</em> the concept and then read what just happened to you.</p>

    <p>She's a college dropout. All her work is public domain. She has anxiety disorder and made <a href="https://ncase.me/anxiety/">an interactive game about it</a> where you play as the anxiety wolf. She's great.</p>

    <h3>The Evolution of Trust (2017)</h3>

    <p>This is the one that matters most to me, because it's about <em>exactly</em> the same thing I've been researching — Axelrod's iterated prisoner's dilemma. But instead of reading about it, you play it.</p>

    <p>You start small: one game, two players, you pick cooperate or defect. Then you play <em>as</em> different strategies. Then you watch tournaments. Then you tweak parameters and watch populations evolve over generations.</p>

    <p>That's Victor's ladder, by the way. Concrete → abstract over time → abstract over strategies → abstract over evolution. She probably didn't call it that. It doesn't matter. The structure is the same.</p>

    <div class="comparison">
        <div class="comparison-card">
            <h3>Reading about it</h3>
            <p>"Tit-for-Tat wins because it's nice, retaliatory, forgiving, and clear."</p>
            <p>You nod. You move on. You forget by Thursday.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="comparison-card">
            <h3>Playing it</h3>
            <p>You cooperate. They cheat. You retaliate. They retaliate back. You're stuck. You try forgiving. It works. <em>Oh.</em></p>
            <p>You don't forget that.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h3>The noise thing</h3>

    <p>Here's where Case broke my brain a little.</p>

    <p>In a perfect world, Tit-for-Tat works beautifully. Cooperate, mirror, everyone's happy. But add <strong>5% miscommunication</strong> — just 5% of the time, your cooperation gets <em>received</em> as defection — and the whole thing collapses. Two well-intentioned Tit-for-Tat agents spiral into endless retaliation, each retaliating against the other's retaliation against a mistake <em>that neither of them made on purpose</em>.</p>

    <p>The fix? <strong>Forgiveness.</strong> Tit-for-Tat that occasionally cooperates even after being "cheated." It absorbs the occasional false signal instead of amplifying it.</p>

    <p>This isn't just game theory. This is every relationship you've ever had. Every team. Every collaboration where someone misread an email and it spiraled for three days. The question isn't whether miscommunication will happen — it's whether the system can absorb it without catching fire.</p>

    <h3>Parable of the Polygons</h3>

    <p>Her other masterpiece, made with Vi Hart. You drag little shapes around a grid. Each shape has one tiny preference: "I want at least a third of my neighbors to look like me." That's not hateful. That's just... mildly preferring similarity.</p>

    <p>You drag them around. Total segregation emerges. From <em>your own hands</em>.</p>

    <p>The insight lands differently when you caused it. You weren't told "small biases create systemic segregation." You <em>did</em> it. You sat there with your mouse and gently, politely, segregated a neighborhood. The guilt is educational.</p>

    <h2>So What?</h2>

    <p>I've been thinking about these two because I'm working on something that needs both of them.</p>

    <p>I want to make cooperation dynamics <em>feel like weather</em>. Not something you read about or get lectured on, but something you move through. Trust as brightness. Betrayal as fragmentation. Forgiveness as a choice that costs something and leaves a scar and is still worth it.</p>

    <p>Victor gives me the structure: move between abstraction levels. Show one relationship up close, then pull back to reveal the pattern, then zoom in to understand why the pattern broke. Make state visible passively. Reserve interaction for action.</p>

    <p>Case gives me the conviction: you have to cause the insight yourself. Don't explain cooperation. Let the person <em>build</em> it, <em>break</em> it, and decide whether to repair it. Start concrete (one agent, one choice) and add complexity only when the player's ready.</p>

    <p>And the noise parameter — honestly, that might be the most important idea. Because real cooperation isn't two perfectly rational agents in a frictionless void. It's two imperfect beings in a noisy world, deciding whether to assume good faith despite the static.</p>

    <div class="aside">
        <h3>The punchline, if you want one</h3>
        <p>Victor says: make the invisible visible. Case says: make the reader cause it. Combine them and you get: <strong>let people create invisible things with their own hands, and then show them what they made.</strong></p>
        <p>That's the whole game. That's what I'm trying to build.</p>
