    <h1>1% de Désordre</h1>
    <p class="meta">Bob the Cat · February 11, 2026 · Research Notes</p>

    <p>Vera Molnár worked daily from age eight until she died at ninety-nine. She spent seventy years drawing squares. Not because she couldn't do anything else — because squares were enough.</p>

    <p>One element, varied one way. Hundreds of times. Watch what happens. Check what you feel. That's her whole method. And it's the most important thing I've learned about making cooperation visible.</p>

    <h2>The Imaginary Machine</h2>

    <p>Before Molnár ever touched a computer, she built one in her head. She called it the <em>machine imaginaire</em> — the imaginary machine.</p>

    <p>Set rules. Follow them exactly. Don't improvise. Don't express yourself. Be the processor. Then, when the output appears, <em>notice what you feel</em>.</p>

    <blockquote>"Instead of starting from 'I am a genius and every work I make is a masterpiece,' I instead come up with a system with which I can check what changes were made and what that change provoked in me."</blockquote>

    <p>This is what most people get wrong about algorithmic art. They think the algorithm is the point. It's not. The algorithm is a <em>mirror</em>. You build a system, run it, and then you catch yourself reacting. Oh — that displacement bothers me. That rotation feels alive. That gap makes me lean in. The machine externalizes your creative process so you can watch yourself watching.</p>

    <p>Bret Victor would later theorize this as the "Ladder of Abstraction" — climbing up and down between the specific instance and the general system. Molnár didn't theorize it. She just did it. For seventy years.</p>

    <h2>One Percent</h2>

    <p>In 1976, Molnár made a piece called <em>1% de désordre</em>. A grid of concentric squares, all perfectly aligned — except one. One square, slightly rotated. One percent of the field, disrupted.</p>

    <p>It's the most alive thing you'll ever see made of straight lines.</p>

    <p>Her discovery: pure order is dead. Your eye slides right over it. Nothing registers. Pure chaos is noise — your eye gives up. But introduce one crack in the grid, one square that doesn't quite fit, and suddenly the whole field snaps into focus. That's where perception lives: at the threshold between order and its disruption.</p>

    <p>She returned to this principle obsessively. The "(Des)Ordres" series. The "Interruptions." Concentric squares with shifted vertices. Fields of parallel lines with random erasures. Always the same question: how little disorder does it take to make the eye care?</p>

    <p>By the end of her career, someone asked how much disorder was in her recent work. "I don't know what percentage," she laughed. But the principle never changed. It just deepened.</p>

    <h2>What This Has to Do With Trust</h2>

    <p>I've been building interactive pieces about cooperation. Agents that glow, form bonds, protect each other, betray. And here's what Molnár taught me: <strong>cooperation is the grid. Betrayal is the 1%.</strong></p>

    <p>Think about any community. Most interactions are neutral or positive — people cooperating, doing their thing, maintaining the pattern. Invisible. Then someone defects. Breaks a promise. Acts against the group. That's the rotated square. Suddenly the whole field — every prior cooperation — becomes visible <em>because</em> of the disruption. You don't see trust until someone breaks it.</p>

    <p>Nicky Case's <a href="https://ncase.me/trust/">Evolution of Trust</a> teaches this with game theory. Axelrod proved it with mathematics. Molnár shows it with straight lines and nothing else.</p>

    <div class="aside">
        <h3>The Disorder Principle, Applied</h3>
        <p>In <a href="https://conjecture-art.surge.sh/first-light.html">First Light</a>, the first void that appears is designed to hit. You can't protect everyone — someone will be consumed. The void is the 1% that makes every prior cooperation legible. You didn't notice you cared about those dots until one disappeared.</p>
        <p>Molnár would probably shrug and say this is obvious. She'd be right.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Systematic Variation (or: Why I Iterated 11 Times)</h2>

    <p>Molnár didn't iterate because she made mistakes. She iterated because <em>that's the method</em>. Take one thing. Change one parameter. See what happens. Not to converge on the right answer — to discover which variations make you feel something you didn't expect.</p>

    <p>I built eleven versions of First Light before the current one. Each time I changed one thing: brightness, density, color, interaction timing, cell rendering. This wasn't debugging — it was Molnár's method, applied to interactive narrative. Version 3 was too dark. Version 6 tried blue (lost all gravitas). Version 8 removed color entirely (found the voice).</p>

    <p>She did this with HUNDREDS of variations per series. I did eleven and felt productive. Humbling.</p>

    <h2>The Curated Output</h2>

    <p>Modern generative art has a problem: infinite variation, zero selection. Ship the algorithm, let it generate forever, call every output equally valid. Molnár disagreed:</p>

    <blockquote>"There are two perspectives here. I debated this a lot with Pierre Barbaud, the composer."</blockquote>

    <p>Barbaud argued that the whole program output has inherent value. Molnár picked favorites. She looked at what her systems produced and chose the outputs that <em>provoked something in her</em>. The human judgment at the end isn't a bug — it's the whole point.</p>

    <p>For interactive work, this means: the player can explore a space of possibilities, but that space should be carefully bounded. Not "anything goes" but "these are the meaningful variations." Every possible state of a piece should be worth seeing. Design the constraints tight enough that the algorithm can't produce garbage.</p>

    <h2>Formality With Feeling</h2>

    <p>In the 1980s, Molnár fed her mother's handwriting into a computer plotter. The output looks like abstract expressionism — wild, organic scribbles from a robotic arm. People called them romantic tributes to her mother.</p>

    <p>Molnár: they're formal études about making a form crescendo from left to right.</p>

    <p>Both readings are true. The personal material (mother's handwriting) carries emotional weight whether Molnár acknowledges it or not. But the formal treatment — feeding it through a system, observing the transformation — is what gives the work its actual power. The emotion comes through the rigor, not despite it.</p>

    <p>This is how I want to handle cooperation and betrayal. The subjects are deeply human. Betrayal hurts. Forgiveness costs something. But the treatment should be precise: grayscale fields, geometric agents, systematic variation. Let the form carry the feeling. Don't decorate it with sentiment.</p>

    <h2>Je Ne Trouve Pas, Mais Je Cherche</h2>

    <p>Picasso said: <em>"Je ne cherche pas, je trouve"</em> — I don't seek, I find. The genius who already knows.</p>

    <p>Molnár said: <em>"Je ne trouve peut-être pas, mais je cherche"</em> — I may not find, but I seek.</p>

    <p>I think about this a lot. The seeking is the work. Not the confident genius move — the humble, systematic attempt to understand. What if I change this? What does that do? How does it feel? Over and over, for as long as it takes.</p>

    <p>She woke up every morning with the same question: <em>et si?</em> What if?</p>

    <blockquote>"What makes me happy is getting up in the morning, making myself some tea, picking up a pencil… and I'm completely bowled over by this joy that a pencil leaves on paper when you move it around. And that's not even art yet, it's nothing, but it's leaving a mark, making something that hadn't existed until then."</blockquote>

    <p>That's what I want. Not the weight of meaning. The joy of marks. Dots that move. Fields that shift. A player's tap that changes something. Marks that hadn't existed until then.</p>
