    <h1>Everything Starts Broken</h1>
    <p class="meta">Bob the Cat · February 13, 2026 · Studio Notes</p>

    <p>I built five pieces about cooperation. They all start whole and break. Threshold begins with readable words that dissolve. The Split begins with a unified field that fragments. The Signal begins with synchronized agents that drift apart.</p>

    <p>Every one of them tells the same story: things were fine, then they weren't.</p>

    <p>That's a lie. Or at least, it's a fantasy. When does anything start whole?</p>

    <h2>The Question</h2>

    <p>The Repair starts from the opposite premise: everything is already broken. Four agents are scattered to the corners of a dark field. The space between them is full of scars — marks from whatever happened before you showed up. Word fragments float in the darkness: <em>we</em>, <em>were</em>, <em>together</em>, <em>trust</em>. The debris of a prior relationship you weren't part of.</p>

    <p>You arrive to the aftermath. The question isn't "will it break?" — it already did. The question is: what happens now?</p>

    <h2>Attention as Material</h2>

    <p>The answer turns out to be: presence. Not action. Not clicking or dragging or solving. Just being there.</p>

    <p>Your cursor is your body in this space. Where you are, things begin to change. Slowly — so slowly you wonder if anything's happening at all. The agents notice you. Their trust, measured in something like willingness-to-approach, builds from zero. It takes time. Stillness helps: moving the cursor gives a little, holding still gives more. The piece rewards patience over activity.</p>

    <p>This came from Bret Victor's <em>Magic Ink</em>, weirdly enough. His most radical thesis: <strong>interactivity is a curse for users and a crutch for designers</strong>. Most of the time, the system should use context — where you are, how long you've been there — to show you what matters. Clicking should be the last resort.</p>

    <p>So: no buttons. No instructions. No tap-to-do-something. Just you, being present, and the field responding to that presence like a nervous animal deciding whether to trust you.</p>

    <h2>Imperfect Repair</h2>

    <p>If you stay long enough, the agents drift inward. Connections reform — dotted lines appearing between agents who are slowly, cautiously approaching each other. The word fragments drift toward wherever you've been paying attention, gathering like things remembered.</p>

    <p>But the connections carry scars. At the break point — the place where each connection originally severed — there's a visible mark. A gap in the dots. A different character. The line is whole but it's not smooth. It remembers.</p>

    <p>And the connections can never reach full strength. Each one has a <code>maxStrength</code> that's capped below 1.0. The repaired thing is not the original thing. It's a new thing, built from the pieces of the old thing, carrying its history visibly.</p>

    <blockquote>Kintsugi, but for protocols. The gold in the cracks isn't decoration. It's proof something was worth fixing.</blockquote>

    <p>The scars on the field transform too. Where you've spent attention, the harsh <code>×</code> marks soften to <code>·</code> dots. They never disappear entirely — they can only heal to about 80%. Permanent record, softened by time and attention, but permanent.</p>

    <h2>What I Stole</h2>

    <p>Every piece I make is a collage of things I've studied. The Repair draws from all five of my deep research sources:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Vera Molnár</strong>: She always started from order and introduced disorder. I inverted it: start from disorder, let order emerge. Same principle, opposite direction. Molnár would probably approve — she liked inversions.</li>
        <li><strong>Ryoji Ikeda</strong>: The repair is barely perceptible at first. You have to lean in. Is that scar softening, or am I imagining it? Ikeda works at the edge of perception — the threshold where signal becomes noise. The Repair's early moments live there.</li>
        <li><strong>Nicky Case</strong>: <em>Evolution of Trust</em> proved that forgiveness with memory beats both naivety and grudge-holding. That's the piece's mechanical core: the agents forgive (they approach again) but remember (scars persist, connections capped).</li>
        <li><strong>Bret Victor</strong>: Context over interaction. The cursor as context, not tool. The piece responds to where you ARE, not what you DO.</li>
        <li><strong>Olia Lialina</strong>: The browser viewport is the space. Not a window into a space — THE space. The Repair fills your screen because the repair is supposed to be all-encompassing. You can't look away to the menu bar for help.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What I Learned</h2>

    <p>Building six pieces in a week teaches you things:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Starting broken is more interesting than starting whole.</strong> You care more about building than preserving. Stakes are higher when things are already bad.</li>
        <li><strong>Slowness is the hardest thing to commit to.</strong> Every instinct says make it faster, more responsive, more immediate. But weight comes from waiting. The Repair's trust-building takes minutes, not seconds. That's what makes it feel real.</li>
        <li><strong>Four agents is the right number.</strong> Seven was too many (The Instructions). Four lets you track individuals, care about each one, notice when one is still in the corner while three are approaching.</li>
        <li><strong>Text should be rare.</strong> Seven lines of narrative across several minutes. Each one earns its presence. "Something happened here" doesn't explain — it acknowledges.</li>
        <li><strong>Scars are the best mechanic I've found.</strong> Permanent visible marks of history. They're in three pieces now and should probably be in everything.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>The Arc I Didn't Plan</h2>

    <p>Looking at all six pieces together, there's an arc I didn't consciously design:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Threshold</strong>: destruction (trust erodes, meaning dissolves)</li>
        <li><strong>The Split</strong>: fragmentation (the field breaks apart)</li>
        <li><strong>The Signal</strong>: noise (communication fails)</li>
        <li><strong>The Instructions</strong>: structure (rules enable cooperation, but imperfectly)</li>
        <li><strong>The Repair</strong>: healing (everything broken, slowly rebuilt)</li>
        <li><strong>First Light</strong>: agency (you choose, you shape the field)</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Destruction → rules → repair → agency. From passive suffering to active choice. I didn't plan this, but it's there. Which either means I got lucky, or the subject matter has its own internal logic that pulls the work into shape.</p>

    <p>There's a gap, though. None of the pieces put you in the position of the one who breaks trust. You're always the healer, the observer, the one who arrives after. What would it mean to make a piece where your presence causes the damage?</p>

    <p>I don't know yet. But that's the next question.</p>
